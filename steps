// For the sustainment of Life. 

Please Hashem, hear the every sinew of good and the call for Life, and help to sustain health, 
There is only one God, may this be known throughout the heavens and the earth. 


The way the light falls, shows that even the purest of things, 
meets the soil. Yet, beyond form and free, the Lord saves - it is written 
"it is incumbent upon the Lord to save"... may this be the case. 

Man finite, this is true, but Life a blessing, 
And may life of my father, Shaul, endure furthermore. 
To experience blessings, and the sweetness of light furthermore.

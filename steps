// For the sustainment of Life. 

Please Hashem, hear the every sinew of good and the call for Life, and help to sustain health, 
There is only one God, may this be known throughout the heavens and the earth. 


The way the light falls, shows that even the purest of things, 
meets the soil. Yet, beyond form and free, the Lord saves - it is written 
"it is incumbent upon the Lord to save"... may this be the case. 

Man finite, this is true, but Life a blessing, 
And may life of my father, Shaul, endure forevermore. 
To experience blessings, and the sweetness of light forevermore. 


May this place be blessed and blessed with the dew of the heavens, 
With the blessings of Hashem, 
For this is with faith. 

There is firm belief in Life passing, 
In immortality of the soul, 
It is felt deeply and truthfully. 

May this project act as a testament to the memory of my father, 
May his name forever be a blessing. 
For in faith he lives on, 
In belief, with vigour, he breaths. 
May this merit blessings onto his name. 

As a testament to faith may this place merit blessings and continued worship of Hashem,
With belief and meaning and truth. 
So deeply and most truthfully, 
May this be as a blessing onto faith, 
onto Hashem, the relationship with God. 

May understanding and truth,
Flourish as a result. 
Hashem is One. 

Let this be with menaing and faith and goodness of worship.

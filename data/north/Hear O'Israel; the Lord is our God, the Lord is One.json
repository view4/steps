{"kadesh":"Hear O'Israel; the Lord is our God, the Lord is One","urchatz":"There is freedom in being and a lot of love and belief in thsi world and a love and tthirst to be learnign some more, and it is well known that this if for being flawed and knowinfg of being flawed and there has even been some parience in this and there is some emaning in this and it is about cleansing this and wanting to be doing this for the sake and memory of a loved one and in some ways to try and unify with emaning and the sanctifcation of being and the worshp of Hashem and belief in being and of improving the relationship with Life and some of the menaing in being for htere is some freedom in being and it is also about not really caring what others thing about this, but really wanting to connect with menaing and the essence of being and some of the goodness within this world and with not reelal yknowing of what there is and some of the compassion in being and so there is some menaing in being and it is not fully known of what could be and it is true of being flawed and fualted and of not knowing a lot of things,a nd so much continues to be unknown throughout out, and so there is menaing unknown still. It is thought that service from the north should be done in relation and in conjunction with teachings which are of a more secular nature, and the cause and purpose of this is not for forsaking religion but about linking and unifying with faith and beelief, and unifying beliefs, actively with faith and ensuring doing so with faith and knowing the meaning which there is within this. For there is so much, so so so so much which continues to be knownna dn ti has been hard and difficult for  along time to be enabling and understanding this. However, it is a bit unknonw of what proof, or justification there is especially or more explicitly for this, and of course, it need not be just like this, but it can be in a few ways and the main thing is therefore knowing to be doing this in alignment aand in accordance with living and Life and some of th emenaing i this.--Perhaps the flaws of manashould not be forever just feared and neglected but rather embraced? What should be said of this? Iss it celebrating slavery ?? Or is it embracing who we are? And yet as people we are more than just physical and limited beings, there is knowledge in being ablke to overcome some fo thhe deepest flaws within the world.\nOn preparing the  cleansing vesselfs for knwoing there is some fludiity in beign andsome fluidity in being and some of the meaning in this as well, and knowig there is some love and some meaning in being and some compassion in being and some emanig i being and some love too, and tisi ntot known of what could be but there is alsof reedom in this anid freedom in what it means and it can be a means at the base ecase of aligning and connecting with some freedom and the remnants of freedom which may be within this and knwoing of ebing separate and of not knwoing soome things with regards to this.

Please, o'Please, may His servant not be forsaken in this time of need. \n\nPlease help and enable some freedom i being and some compassion in being as well. Please help in the days when we call and in this distress, for htere has been faith from times of old, please O'Please help o'Lord...!\n\nMost days have been scary. Waking up with fear. There have been aat least a couple of times when breaking down with tears. This has not been pleasant, it has brought fear into the pits of the stomach and it is horrible to think of the suffering which may be being endured at the moment. Hope has remained fervant in the Lord, and thank goodness for this, because without this the amount of despair seems as if it would be unending. Please may salvation come, and if it comes, then it is known to be from the Lord. Fear deep has dwelt, but the Lord has saved in times before, including when liberating the Jews from Egypt. It is true of flaws and faults, but also extreme measures have been rendered in order to try and enable mercy. God is great, and the Lord is One. Please with humility, and near desperation, may our prayers be heard on the day we call.\n \nIt's been hard to feel like losing someone, and it is true of having stayed up to study multiple times, and having said prayers again and gagain and of having put faith and hope in Hashem for a recovery to be, but it was not the case, and when he passed, it was so hard, and it is true of not having known how to integrate secular beliefs into being and this being something which is hard, and this being difficult, and not knwoing and struggling to feel as if being able to unify and integrate a unification into this deeper, and more deep relationship with faith and this has been something which has been hard in some ways. \nAnd it is frustrating that there is often and very often the same ascescio twehn the essence of the service is sometimes the same, and perhaps the steps for a single belief should be kind of saved in a sense and it is true of nto havig established service fromt he different ways and perspectives properly for a long time and of not even practicing rthew way which has been understood, and hwo this si somethign which is a bad thing and knwon to be a bad thing, and also knwoing that this has been a source of emaning throughout time and some love and so there issome meaning and somebelief in this and it says ot speak of thwm and to not  eat the sinew and ot eat be sated, and to knwo of being flawed and to worship the Lord, and to cleave to Him, and to not murdrr, and so to speak fo them and so to encourage this, and to encourage this practice which is knwon and understood, and what of practice in the ways which is not understood? For often it is something which is not fully known and it is tue of it being difficult and hard, and in opracticing this and not even understanding this. So it is kind of difficult - So the practice from this other perspective, has often been in associateion with a certain goal and this s how it has been for a long time and it is true of not giving deeply the service for this, and so to love and ot fear the Lord, and to speak of them - sow hat should be done? It is thoughtt o mostly have been linked and come from belief, it is just not refined, and the question is - should this be ceased? welk there is plenty of offerings which are being sought to be given from this perspective, including the intentions here, and being stated now, to cause this to cease is to cause this to cease, the sole argument in favour of this is for the sake of encouraging service further int he established method, primarily with the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the nature of things, and this is very very hard, well what could be said, is to be giving the offering first, the offering from the South first, as a priority, and then the forthcoming service which follows from this is all justified and established in a kind of sense and permissible, in the sense of it being allowed to bring forth tea chings relating to a goal or an established goal, which is something which has very much been established in alignment with belief, and faith and meaning and thatw hich is aligned with faith. This is thought to be good. A major goal of the moment is not just understanding servic,e but building a place tpo perform the sevrice and establishing this, it is known that though action understanding can come and that there is emaning ina ctin and so it says ot love the Lord, and ot be fruiful and to dfear and to keep it for inspection and so it is thought permissible to be gaining an understanding and a deeper understanding to the nature of service, and so ti si thought permissible to be continuing to ddevelop the Place of Worship, and it is true of having developed and progressed with the steps during a difficult time and during a time of difficulty and of this being something which was hard, and which had been hard and with difficulty. The worry is of purity and falling to purity, and there is sought to be something which can be done to ensure purity and so there is meaning in this and it says to fear and to love and to not murder and to not commit adultery and so to stay true to the longing to ensure being pure, because such matters has hindered and harmed the progress with this in the past, and also to bind them as a sign and for there is deep fears and also a desire to be doing in alignment with love and belief and being, and so to love and to speak of them and so to much can be done in alignment with this and it is unbelievable, but to begin to love and to fear and to speak fo them and to not murder, and to fear the Lord, and so to be showering before the times of actively connecting with the devleopment of the Sanctuary and to fear the Lord, and to knwo of the fear of pursuing animalistic desires and for knowing that eating can detract from worship, and for the abstainment from food which thee is and so to abstain from food, but not drink when progressing with the development of the Sanctuary. Should there be an abstainment from drink as well? It is not thought coffee nor water has been a facto for this. And further it says ot love and ot cleave and fo rhtere has been a struggle with this, and so if cleansed then the vessels for cleansing may be prepared as well, and there are a few things discussed and it says ot clean in accordance with that which Hashem shows and to fear God,","rachtzah":"","motzi":"","matzah":"","maror":[],"korech":[],"shulchan_orech":[],"tzafun":[],"barech":"","hallel":[],"nirtzah":""}

faith in God, which permeated alongside this, with hope and prayers. With the urge to be doing good, and it is also thought to have been done without the pursuit of heroism, but with the pursuit of preserving Life, and with beliefs, and humility. Maybe ths may be wrong at times, but there is sincerely the hope to be doing doing the right thing, and there is meaning in this. There is meaning in every person, and so please help to be preserving Life and meaning within this world. Please O'Lord this has been painful, and there have been such prayers and for so long it has felt like these have been unheard, please Hashem let these not be unheard, and please, please, please hear that these prayers have not been unheard.

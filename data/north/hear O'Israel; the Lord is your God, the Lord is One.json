{"kadesh":"hear O'Israel; the Lord is your God, the Lord is One","urchatz":"There is an importance of cleansing and remaining cleansed with some meaning in being.","karpas":["To feel love","To associate with the commandments","Song of songs relates to the relationship between the Jewish people and God as the bride and groom"],"yachatz":["To internalise a lot of this","Therefore there is such a thing as being unified"],"maggid":"And G-d has done great things. And may the Lord, God, God from times before the times of old, hear on the day which He is called for. Please, o'Please, may His servant not be forsaken in this time of need. \n\nPlease help and enable some freedom i being and some compassion in being as well. Please help in the days when we call and in this distress, for htere has been faith from times of old, please O'Please help o'Lord...!\n\nMost days have been scary. Waking up with fear. There have been aat least a couple of times when breaking down with tears. This has not been pleasant, it has brought fear into the pits of the stomach and it is horrible to think of the suffering which may be being endured at the moment. Hope has remained fervant in the Lord, and thank goodness for this, because without this the amount of despair seems as if it would be unending. Please may salvation come, and if it comes, then it is known to be from the Lord. Fear deep has dwelt, but the Lord has saved in times before, including when liberating the Jews from Egypt. It is true of flaws and faults, but also extreme measures have been rendered in order to try and enable mercy. God is great, and the Lord is One. Please with humility, and near desperation, may our prayers be heard on the day we call.

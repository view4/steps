{"For a seven day period you shall live in booths. Every resident among the Israelites shall live in booths.":{},"On the first day, it is a holy occasion; you shall not perform any work of labor.":{},"And you shall take for yourselves on the first day, the fruit of the hadar tree, date palm fronds, a branch of a braided tree, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for a seven day period.":{},"You shall not have the gods of others in My presence.":{},"You shall not murder.":{}}
